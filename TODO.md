TODOs
=========================
* create dhis-mappings.properties user interface, maps openmrs concepts to dhis dataelements
* Create both api and rest support to mappings bridging dhisconnector and dhisreporting for users to use existing reports and mappings to set up things by them selves and make a better way to merge or import in many of such mappings
